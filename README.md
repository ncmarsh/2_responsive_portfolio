## About the Project

This Portfolio site features my most recent projects including live and GitHub repository links, along with my contact information and ways to connect, making it a one-stop-shop!

## Languages and Concepts

- HTML5
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework

## Usage

Users (and hopefully recruiters!) can quickly and easily view my most recent projects accompanied by links to find out more, by being able to view my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles and my resume, along with ways to contact me, including a contact form for the user to connect directly through the website.

## Demo

## Roadmap

Now that I have added some personalized touches to the portfolio, I need to add functionality to the contact form. I would also like to add more projects to the portfolio page. And I would like to explore the idea of a feedback page, where users can offer feedback on what they see, offer advice, or propose new project ideas (either for me to work on or to work on together!)
